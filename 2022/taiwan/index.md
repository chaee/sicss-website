The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science - Taiwan (**“SICSS Taiwan”**), the Russel Sage Foundation and the International College of Innovation of National Chengchi University will host a 6-week training program (the **“Program”**) in the summer of 2022, which aims to promote computational social science and the cross-disciplinary collaboration between social science and data science. Below is an overview of our mission, participants and program. 

## Mission

The mission of the Program is to bring together people who are interested in applying data science and computational methods to better understand human behaviors and social phenomena. Through the Program, we hope to facilitate inclusive learning and effective collaboration in the field of computational social science.

## Participants

The ideal participants of our 6-week Program would be graduate students, researchers, academic faculty and professionals with backgrounds in data science and/or social sciences. Prospective participants will have to apply to our Program. We will admit a cohort of 25 participants to the Program after a rigorous selection process. Our past participants came from either social science or data science (or computer science), or in some cases, a combination of both backgrounds. When selecting our participants, we focus on their experience in using data to solve problems, interest in learning computational social science, and willingness to collaborate with others from different backgrounds. 

## Program

Our Program will be hosted from Jun 20, 2022 through July 30, 2022. It consists of a 4-week bootcamp and a 2-week live hybrid program. The last three days of the hybrid program, July 28 to July 30, will be hosted in person at National Chengchi University. For a summary of the Program, please refer to the Table 1 below and to our [**Schedule**](https://bit.ly/csstaiwan2022) section.  

| Component      | Dates       | Format      | Content    | Notes |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :---------- | :----------|:------|
|Bootcamp|6/20/2022 - 7/17/2022|Self-paged, remote learning program|Programming Language R & Fundamentals of Computational Social Science |We’ll host office hours for questions. |
|Hybrid Program|7/18/2022 - 7/30/2022|Hybrid program of live online and in-person sessions |Guest lectures, Group Problem Sets, Tutorials, Lightning Talks, and Group Projects |In-person sessions: 7/28, 7/29 and 7/30 |

The whole Program is free of charge to our participants. We also offer subsidies in housing and transportation allowances for our participants for the 3-day in-person sessions. Please note that we do require a deposit of NTD 1,500 from each participant, which will be returned at the end of the Program if a participant maintains the required attendance rate.    

Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and our participants for SICSS Taiwan will be released open source.

We welcome potential applicants to find partners to work on your project and apply as a group (組團報名).  Subject to our funding in 2022, we may provide childcare service for our participants. Please [contact us](mailto:sicss.taiwan.2021@gmail.com) for further details if you may need such service. 

## Conclusion

We are excited to welcome new participants to join our Program and our growing cross-disciplinary community!
