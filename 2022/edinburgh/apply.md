# Apply

## Eligibility

The Summer Institute aims to bring together aspiring computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience.  We invite applications from doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their PhD. Exceptional Master’s students in a research-track degree (e.g. MRes, MPhil) or those transitioning to a PhD programme will also be considered. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20-25 participants will be invited. 

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science; 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation; 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants; 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we take applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities into account. 

Participants with less experience in social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
